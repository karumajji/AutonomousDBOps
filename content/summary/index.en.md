## Congratulations! 🎉

You completed **Autonomous DBOps: Agentic AI for maintaining databases** [and the optional AgentCore deployment module - if applicable]. You built an autonomous database management system using AI agents that monitor, analyze, and optimize Aurora PostgreSQL through natural language.

## Key Takeaways

- **Agentic AI can expedite database performance tuning** - AI agents significantly accelerate troubleshooting and optimization workflows by analyzing complex database metrics, parsing through logs, and generating comprehensive recommendations that would traditionally require extensive manual analysis.

- **Build Agentic AI systems for DBOps by adding your specific context (instance metrics, engine logs, execution plans, SQL metrics) to get good results** - The effectiveness of AI agents depends on the quality and specificity of the context you provide. Build tools that surface relevant database information including CloudWatch metrics, PostgreSQL catalog queries, execution plans, and SQL performance data to enable accurate, actionable recommendations.

- **Verify always: LLMs may hallucinate, lacking 100% accuracy** - While AI excels at analysis and pattern recognition, it can occasionally generate incorrect or incomplete recommendations. Human oversight remains essential for production changes to ensure safety, correctness, and alignment with your specific operational requirements.


Thank you for participating in this builder session! 🚀

Enjoy your time at re\:Invent, stay safe, and make the most of the sessions, networking, and hands-on workshops.
